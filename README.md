# picobrew_pico
Allows for full control of the PicoBrew Pico S/C/Pro & Zymatic models.  Shout out to https://github.com/hotzenklotz/picobrew-server and Brian Moineau for PicoFerm API

## Requirements

DNS Forwarding (either through a router, RaspberryPi etc)  
  - Have a Raspberry Pi Zero W : https://albeec13.github.io/2017/09/26/raspberry-pi-zero-w-simultaneous-ap-and-managed-mode-wifi/
  - DD-WRT/Open-WRT etc : Add addional dnsmasq options `address=/picobrew.com/<Server IP running this code>`

### Option 1: Running pre packaged server via Docker
Docker v19.x (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Setup/Run

Setup the following directory structure for use by the server.
```
recipes/
  pico/
  zymatic/
sessions/
  brew/
    active/
    archive/
  ferm/
    active/
    archive/
```

Run server volume mounting the above directory structure

Either provide all variables to docker command directly.

```
docker run -d -it -p 80:80 \
  --mount type=bind,source=<absolute-path-to-recipes>,target=/app/recipes \
  --mount type=bind,source=<absolute-path-to-sessions>,target=/app/sessions \
  chiefwigms/picobrew_pico
```

To view logs check the running docker containers and tail the specific instance's logs directly via docker.

```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
3cfda85cd90c        chiefwigms/picobrew_pico   "/bin/sh -c 'python3…"   45 seconds ago      Up 45 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   relaxed_rhodes
```

```
docker logs -f 3cfda85cd90c
WebSocket transport not available. Install eventlet or gevent and gevent-websocket for improved performance.
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Option 2: Running server via Python directly
Python >= 3.6.9  

#### Setup/Run
Clone this repo, then run  
`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` on *nix or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` as an Administrator in windows  
`sudo python3 server.py` on *nix or `python3 server.py` as an Administrator in windows

## Manual Recipe Editing
The table for adding/removing/editing recipe steps has several validation checks in it, but there is always the possiblity of ruining your Pico.  
  
For Pico S/C/Pro Only: DO NOT EDIT or MOVE Rows 1-3 (Preparing to Brew/Heating/Dough In).  Drain times should all be 0 except for Mash Out (2 minutes) and the last hop addition (5 minutes) (for example, if you only have Hops 1 & 2, set the drain time on Hops 2 to 5, and remove the Hops 3 and 4 rows)
