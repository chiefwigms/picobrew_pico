#   3) Start a session and copy ProductID from the live graph or brew/ferm history on this server

# In order to force specific versions of device firmware there is a feature of the picobrew_pico
# that will support OTA updates to the connected brewing devices which support OTA updates 
# (sorry Zymatic owners).
#
# All Picobrew devices (ZSeries, Pico C/S/Pro, PicoStill, and PicoFerm) will initially request a 
# state update request from the server. Most of these requests contain an identifier x.y.z (semantic version)
# firmware version number. If an older firmware version is sent than what you state here an update will
# be forced on the device upon startup.
# 
# To support bringing your own newer or older firmware binaries to your devices there is a folder
# `./app/firmware/<device_type>` for each and every device type that supports firmware updates over http(s). 
# Feel free to add to these folders other firmware binaries (custom built, newer/older picobrew released) however,
# the formatting of the filename is very important (use at your own risk):
#         `./app/firmware/<device_type>/<device_type>_x_y_z.bin`
#
# Defaults as used by the server are simply mentioned below in comments to show structure of the configuration values.
#
# These defaults are the production OTA releases made and released by Picobrew. Some newer versions have
# been sent to the pico brewing community for early beta testing and are bundled with this server.
