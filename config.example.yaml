# Your device's ProductID can be found via the following ways:
#   1) Via 'Settings'->'Equipment' on www.picobrew.com (proper)
#   2) On the 'About' screen on the device (those devices with screens that is)
#   3) Start a session and copy ProductID from the live graph or brew/ferm history on this server
#
# An alias is setup like the following (omitting the leading '#' which is a symbol to denote a comment):
# aliases:
#   Zymatic:
#     "abc123" : "BrewskiBot"
aliases: 
  Zymatic:
    #ProductID : Nickname
  ZSeries:
    #ProductID : Nickname
  PicoBrew:
    #ProductID : Nickname
  PicoFerm:
    #ProductID : Nickname
  PicoStill:
    #ProductID : Nickname

# In order to force specific versions of device firmware there is a feature of the picobrew_pico
# that will support OTA updates to the connected brewing devices which support OTA updates (sorry Zymatic owners).
#
# All Picobrew devices (ZSeries, Pico C/S/Pro, PicoStill, and PicoFerm) will initially request a state update
# reqeust from the server. Most of these requests contain an identifier x.y.z (semantic versioned) firmware version number.
# If an older firmware version is sent than what you state here an update will be forced on the device upon startup.
# 
# To support bringing your own newer or older firmware binaries to your devices there is a folder `./app/firmware/<device_type>`
# for each and every device type that supports firmware updates over http(s). Feel free to add to these folders filename
# is important however `./app/firmware/<device_type>/<device_type>_x_y_z.bin` (use at your own risk).
#
# Defaults as used by the server as mentioned below in comments. These defaults are the production OTA releases made by Picobrew.
firmware:
  # ZSeries: 0.0.116
  # PicoBrew: 0.1.34
  # PicoStill: 0.0.30
